## Practice Project: Instagram pseudoclone
This practice project implements an instagram style photo sharing application. It features user authentication and database integration using Firebase
and the Firestore, and simple social media functionality such as the ability for users to follow/unfollow each other and view a timeline of photos that
have been recently uploaded by the people they are following as in Instagram. The timeline posts have realtime comment/like/unlike functions implemented and
a sidebar of suggested users to follow based on a simple algorithm which recommends unfollowed users in the network was also included.

## Tech Stack
- Javascript, React (Create React App)
- Tailwind 
- Firebase, Firestore
- Vercel

## Objectives
The main objective of this practice project was to figure out and integrate the fundamentals of coding in React. This was the first proper nontrivial project I have done in React which brought together the basics of routing, authentication, database API calls, async/await programming, working
in JSX, using React Hooks and the Context API and heavy styling using Tailwind.
